Ghost in the Shell and the Post-cyberpunk movement

# Cyberpunk:
* science is evil and is contrôled by the few
* dystopic
* paroxysm of individualism
* the heroes are marginalized and tries to carve themselves a life out of the corrupted society (crime, ...)

Exemples:



# Post-cyberpunk
* created in reaction to cyberpunk
* science is neutral
* characters are part of the society
* goal is to fit into the order or to make it better
* may be optimistic (not always)
* talk about the social impact of technology


# Post-cyberpunk in GITS
* characters well integrated in society (they have jobs)
* science is clearely neutral
* the characters learn about their humanity
* tech is COHERENT AF
* talk about the nature of humanity, what it means to be human

# the franchise

Ghost in the Shell (aka “Mobile Armored Riot Police” au japon)
is a franchise created by the mangaka Masamune Shirow (aka Outa Masanori)
telling the story of the Section 9, an android black ops force operating in a furitistic japan.
In GITS, prostetics and science advanced so much that almost everyone is at least partialy cybernetized, (brain first).
Some are so augmented that only some brain cell are left organic in their body.
The only thing making a difference between a human and an IA is that every human possess a *Ghost*, which is basicaly the mind as it is stored in the brain.
This is actualy a materialistic concept comming from *The Ghost in the Machine*, by the philosopher Arthur Koestler.
Those thorougly augmented persons are called cyborgs, a ghost in a shell of metal and ceramics.



# the 1999 film

![](affiche.png)

This movie focus on the Major Motoko Kusanagi, the operational leader of the section 9, who question her identity.

main characters:
* Major Motoko Kusanagi
* Batou
* Togusa

secondary characters:

* Chief Daisuke Aramaki, aka "the old ape"
* some other guys from section 9



scenes:

# the assassination of the diplomat
t < 4 min
great introduction to the universe, the section 9, and the plot of the movie

# the birth of Motoko
t ~= 4 min
important to show at least partly (especialy the ascending and the waking up of Motoko)

# the trash truck
t=?
interesting, but not that pertinent here

# the pursuit & arrest of the puppet
t=?
shows the inhuman weight of the major
the fight is short so that's cool
the resolution of the fight present the effect of ghost hacking very well

# the “interogation” scene
t= short enought
define what a simulated experience is
crucial
show the doubt the Major starts to have


# the diving scene

t= maybe a bit long

Kusanagi seeks connection with her origin, to prove herselve she is still herselve.
The puppet master taunt them, which is important but not that much
The close shot on kussanagi, where she explain what makes an individual, is excessively important and has to be presented as is.

# doll scene

the doll presents a ghost in its auxiliary brain, although there is nothing organic


# elevator scene
t=short

kusanagi fears that she may be a machine, since apparently a ghost isn't even enought to make one human

# parking scene

cool but not relevant

# pupet master scene w section 6

very important, maybe a little dense

# IA ladies micro-scene

well those are real IA so that's important


# fight the tank
t ~= 6 min (or even less)

has to show the body breaking appart
=> Motoko doesn't care about her body, as she doesn't count it as part of her


# the merge
t = 8 min (too long)
this scene is too long, but is too important not to be summarized

# end scene

By merging with the puppet master, Motoko has ascended to a new level of existence.
This is the end of the opposition between machine and humanity, an end by merging.

** corporations + corruption -> cyberpunk
** la vue interne du système, la neutralité de la technologie, l'introspection => post-cyberpunk
