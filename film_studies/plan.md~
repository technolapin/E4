```
speech:
	Section 9 chase the puppet master, a mysterious hacker implanting false memories in their victimes' ghost
	While doing so, the Major, a full armored cyborg, starts to introspect.
```

### The plot

In *very* short:

The pupet master is actually a spying program that became self-aware.
The hacks were to reach out to Motoko, so that they could propose her a merge, as they would complete each other's fault.
And so do they.

### The *real* plot

The real story is the introspection of Motoko.

Several events in the movie makes her rethink her status as a human being.

#### At the begining

Motoko's body is not human

* Motoko is a full cyborg
* She's a tank
* Her body is just a tool

She also behaves deshumanized.

* When she wakes up, she just put a jacket on and leave her crude flat.
* She never blinks, or rarely.
* She's distant and doesn't display her emotions.
* She doesn't look concerned by her body

#### The Simulated experience

The puppet master hacks into his victims' ghost in order to modify their memories and to make them act as he want them to.
Because all the Major has is her memories, she starts to worry even that might be manufactured by someone.
Seeking origin, she goes diving in order to feel what her making felt like.
Because she doesn't care about her body, she feels like her ghost is being confined, restrained in a shell that's limiting her

#### The artificial ghost

A ghost (the pupet master) is found in the memory of a brainless cyber body.
Now Motoko starts to fear she might not even be human, but be entierly manufactured, like that ghost.
She decides she absolutly need to find out by herselve by diving into that body, at all cost.

#### The merge

The puppet master propose her to merge, she accepts.
She's not confined anymore, and she is now sure of what she is.

### A Post Cyberpunk Story

This is clearely a post-cyberpunk story.

The states of minds of the Major *and* the events tells the story of a confrontation between humanity and machines, leading to an unificaton.


We already talked a lot about the Major's toughts, so let's talk about the rest.
