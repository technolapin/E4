Ghost in the Shell and the Post-cyberpunk movement

# Cyberpunk:
* science is evil and is contr√¥led by the few
* dystopic
* paroxysm of individualism
* the heroes are marginalized and tries to carve themselves a life out of the corrupted society (crime, ...)

Exemples:


# Post-cyberpunk
* created in reaction to cyberpunk
* science is neutral
* characters are part of the society
* goal is to fit into the order or to make it better
* may be optimistic (not always)
* talk about the social impact of technology


# Post-cyberpunk in GITS
* characters well integrated in society (they have jobs)
* science is clearely neutral
* the characters learn about their humanity
* tech is COHERENT AF
* talk about the nature of humanity, what it means to be human
