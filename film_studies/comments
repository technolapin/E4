The interesting thing about the “based on a true story” warning at the begining of the movie is that it is a complete lie.
Also, there was a documentary about a woman who died trying to find the lost treasure of the film, because of that same lie.
However, this one was also pure invention, based on some urban legends about Fargo.
I didn't know this movie before, but it is surrounded by myths and triggers the imagination because of that “based on a true story”.
It is a saying that reallity often surpasses any fiction, and because the film is presented as reality, all the discombobulating situation of this movie are more likely to not break the willing suspension of disbelief of the spectator.
